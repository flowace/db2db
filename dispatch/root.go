	Short: "Blazing fast database migration, encryption and modification tool",
	Long: `db2db is witten to migrate huge SQL databases from one enviromment to another
while applying encryption on certain columns and certain tables. It can also ommit some
columns and you can also apply some basic function on the dabase while migrating 
it which makes one of kind of a kind on its own. You can also migrate to multiple databases
from one source or import from multiple database into one database. Currently we are supporting
the following databases
	- MySQL
	- PostgreSQL
	- Sqlite3
	- SQL Server
	- MariaDB
You can also use CSV file or excel sheet to upload into a database or even on a multiple database
at the same time. This uses Go's awesome coroutines to achieve concurrency. This achieves extraordiany
performance and speed.
